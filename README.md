# Randomega 

A mega repo of my ideas and projects. Could be anything! 

Some personal constraints I have on this: 

- I have to work on this repo everyday for at least 30 min. per day.
- I have to push to this repo at least once a day.

This repo can contain anything! JS projects, Python projects, Go projects, etc. 

Each idea/project will live in it's own directory.
